### Pyspark Repository 
Building a remote repository for all my pyspark hobby project notebooks.

- Spark version 3.5.0
- jupyterlab - compatible for 3.5.0
- Delta lake - 3.0.0 which is compatible with Spark version above

Bhanu bhaiyya's tip : make sure you build the image with the compatible versions, else you will waste a lot of time debugging what went wrong.

  ========================================
#### Important Commands
- docker-compose build --no-cache   (for rebuilding the image after you do some changes to configs etc)
- docker compose up (to start the container)
- docker compose down (to stop the containers)

  ========================================
